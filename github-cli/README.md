## Usage

### Installation

Download binary from [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) repository:
```shell
curl -fsSLo "gh_2.73.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz" "https://github.com/cli/cli/releases/download/v2.73.0/gh_2.73.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz"
```

Extract the tar file:
```shell
tar -xf gh_2.73.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
```

Copy binary to your /usr/local/bin:
```shell
sudo cp gh_2.73.0_linux_amd64/bin/gh /usr/local/bin/
```

Get gh cli version:
```shell
gh version
```

### Uninstall

Delete binary in /usr/local/bin:
```shell
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/gh
```

### Authentication

Authenticate against `github.com` by reading the token from a file:
```shell
gh auth login --with-token < mytoken.txt
```

Use this method when your token is stored in an environment variable (e.g., in CI/CD pipelines or scripts). The token is piped into the gh auth login command via standard input:
```shell
echo "$GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN" | gh auth login --with-token
```

### Install GitHub CLI with Arkade

Run `arkade get` and follow the instructions:
```shell
